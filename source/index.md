# Universal BCOS

Universal BCOS (UBCOS) is a next-generation blockchain tailored for the Web3 economy. Built to financial-grade standards, UBCOS features a highly open network with robust Web3 capabilities and seamless user experience, all of which are engineered for laying a solid foundation for the development of Hong Kong’s Web3 ecosystem.

## Key advantages

UBCOS offers several key advantages:

- **High Performance:** UBCOS utilizes an advanced Block-Level Pipelining (BLP) architecture and Deterministic Multi-Contract (DMC) technologies, which enables secure block production and transaction validation within a second. Such performance and security makes UBCOS perfectly suited for business settings that entail large transaction volumes, such as online payments.

- **Open for Public Access:** UBCOS defines various types of nodes and invites different participants to join as consensus, data, and application nodes. This open design sows the seeds for a vibrant and inclusive ecosystem with clear oversight.

- **Plug & Play:** UBCOS seamlessly integrates with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and supports Solidity smart contracts. This allows developers to use popular tools like MetaMask, Remix, and Hardhat to build applications on the platform with ease. Added to that, UBCOS also offers extensive toolkits for Decentralized Identity (DID), Cross-Chain, Oracles, and other development needs.

- **Regulation Friendly:** UBCOS comes with integrated KYB (Know Your Business) and KYT (Know Your Transaction) functionalities, facilitating institution onboarding, contract approval, and transaction auditing. It provides versatile governance tools and a compliance monitoring platform, empowering businesses and developers to operate efficiently within regulatory frameworks.

With its financial-grade capabilities, regulator friendly architecture, extensive developer support, and dynamic ecosystem, UBCOS presents a reliable choice for Hong Kong’s Web3 infrastructure.

## Universal BCOS & FISCO BCOS

UBCOS is derived from [FISCO BCOS](https://github.com/FISCO-BCOS/FISCO-BCOS), a financial-grade open source blockchain platform, and optimized for Web3 scenarios. Initiated in 2017 by FISCO (Financial Services Blockchain Consortium (Shenzhen)), FISCO BCOS has been created to serve as a trusted infrastructure for the digital economy. Delivering financial-grade performance and security, this open platform has immense potential in unleashing data value to empower industrial digitalization and the Web3 economy.
