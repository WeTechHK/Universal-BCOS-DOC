# How to build a dapp

## Introduction

Many Universal BCOS development standards focus on token interfaces. These standards help ensure smart contracts remain composable, so for instance when a new project issues a token, that it remains compatible with existing decentralized exchanges.

## Token standards

Here are some of the most popular token standards on Universal BCOS:

- [ERC-20](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20/) - A standard interface for fungible (interchangeable) tokens, like voting tokens, staking tokens or virtual currencies.

### NFT standards

- [ERC-721](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) - A standard interface for non-fungible tokens, like a deed for artwork or a song.
- [ERC-1155](/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-1155/) - ERC-1155 allows for more efficient trades and bundling of transactions â€“ thus saving costs. This token standard allows for creating both utility tokens (such as $BNB or $BAT) and Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks.
