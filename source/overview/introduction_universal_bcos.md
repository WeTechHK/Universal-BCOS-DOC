# What is Universal BCOS

## Overview

The current blockchain in Web3 suffers from insufficient performance, low security, and high transaction fee, making it difficult to meet the needs of financial-grade applications.Universal BCOS (or UBCOS for short) is an open-source blockchain platform that combines financial-grade functionality and openness with high-performance, high security, and compliance. It is built collaboratively by an open community, remaining technology agnostic and open for participation. Based on Universal BCOS, you can build financial-grade infrastructure for Web3 application scenarios (e.g. Stablecoin, Real World Assets (RWA), DePin, etc.) on a global scale.

## Design Goals

### Financial-grade

- High Performance
	- Over 10K tps in concurrency along with sub-second finallization

- High Security:
	- Comprehensive safety design, 100% tested by third-party certification organizations
	- Built-in tools to meets regulatory requirements

### Open

- Open source: All infrastructure and governance source code is open
- Open compatibility: Compatible with EVM for seamless migration of solidity contracts
- Open participation: Suppports different roles to join the network with diverse nodes

## The connection between Universal BCOS and FISCO BCOS

The relationship between Universal BCOS and FISCO BCOS:
- Universal BCOS is the international version developed based on FISCO BCOS, dedicated to serving the development of Web3 in overseas regions.
- Universal BCOS and FISCO BCOS develop in parallel, with future features being interoperable and ecological resources shared between them.
- Currently, the organizing and operating entity of Universal BCOS is WeTech, with plans to introduce more institutions to participate in its joint construction in the future.

## FISCO BCOS achievement

By the end of 2023, the FISCO BCOS open-source community had gathered over 5,000 enterprises and institutions, as well as more than 100,000 individual members for collaborative governance, developing into one of the most vibrant blockchain technology open-source communities in China. With its robust technology and thriving open-source ecosystem, FISCO BCOS has successively won numerous international and domestic awards, receiving widespread recognition from both the industry and academia. The platform was awarded the First Prize in the 2018 Shenzhen Financial Technology Special Award. It is the first domestically produced consortium chain underlying platform adapted by the Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN), which was top-down designed by the National Information Center. It was also among the first to pass the "National Blockchain Technology Product Certification" by the Beijing National Financial Technology Certification Center and the highest-level evaluation of the "Blockchain Preferred Program" by the National Research Center for Industrial Information Security and Development. In the "Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology Use Cases" report released by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), two out of the four Chinese use cases were developed based on FISCO BCOS. A core technical paper on FISCO BCOS was successfully selected for presentation at the SC23, a top academic conference in the field of international supercomputing, marking the first academic paper on blockchain performance optimization in the history of the SC conference.
