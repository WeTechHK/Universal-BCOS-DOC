Universal BCOS embraces the Ethereum development ecosystem, fully supporting the Solidity contract language up to version 0.8.26.

Universal BCOS uses the EVM implementation called [evmone](https://github.com/ethereum/evmone), which is a C++ implementation and is the high-performing EVM implementation.
