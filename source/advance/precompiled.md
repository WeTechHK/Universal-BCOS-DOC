# Precompiled C++ engine

Precompiled contracts provide a way to use C++The method of writing contracts, which separates contract logic from data, has better performance than solidity contracts, and can be upgraded by modifying the underlying code。

## Precompiled contracts vs. Solidity contracts

Precompiled contracts advantages:

- Access more: Based on this framework, users can access the local DB storage state and implement any logic they need。
- Better performance: Since the precompiled contract implemented on C++, the code will be compiled in Universal BCOS, and the underlying layer without entering the EVM for execution, which can have better performance.
- Easy to start: Developers can use C++ to develop your own precompiled contracts to quickly implement the required business logic without learning the Solidity language.

## Module Architecture

The architecture of Precompiled is shown in the following figure.
The block validator determines the type based on the address of the called contract when executing the transaction。Addresses 1-4 represent Ethereum precompiled contracts, addresses 0x1000-0x10000 are C++Precompiled contracts, other addresses are EVM contracts。

## Key Processes

- When executing a precompiled contract, you first need to get the object of the precompiled contract based on the contract address。
- Each precompiled contract object implements the 'call' interface, where the specific logic of the precompiled contract is implemented。
- 'call' obtains the 'Function Selector' and parameters according to the abi code of the transaction, and then executes the corresponding logic。

        branch1 --> Yes --> op1[Get contract object by address]
        branch1 --> No --> op2[EVM]
        op1 --> op3[Parse Call Function and Parameters]
        op3 --> End(Return execution result)
        op2 --> End(Return execution result)
```

## Precompiled contracts in UBCOS

UBCOS provides several useful precompiled contracts. These contracts are implemented in the platform itself as a native implementation, which means they are part of the Universal BCOS node.

For embracing EVM ecology, the precompiled contracts from address 0x01 through 0x0A are the same as those in any EVM compatible blockchain. The precompiled contracts from address 0x1000 through 0xfffff are C++ precompiled contracts, which are implemented in the Universal BCOS node.

The following table lists the precompiled contracts provided by Universal BCOS.
