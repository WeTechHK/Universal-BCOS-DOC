# Advanced

This chapter provides a comprehensive advanced consensus of the Universal BCOS (UBCOS) blockchain ecosystem.

We'll start with the fundamentals of UBCOS accounts, including their data structure, types, key pairs, and creation processes for both externally-owned accounts (EOAs) and contract accounts.

Next, we'll dive into UBCOS transactions, outlining their prerequisites, data structure, and lifecycle.

Additionally, it explores transaction fees, including gas prices, gas usage, gas limits, and UBCOS-specific gas configurations.

The roles and operation of nodes within the network are discussed, along with consensus algorithms like PBFT and PoS-rPBFT.

Finally, the article examines the execution engines, focusing on the EVM and the precompiled C++ engine.
